## Our Prompt
```
Please use scientific research and well-regarded nutrition sources to determine ingredients and nutrients a balanced diet should include. Then, let's use that information to populate a 4 day meal plan with each day having breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. With each of these meals, please account for the preferences listed in the following paragraph while adding some meals outside of those preferences that may be approachable for autistic people while still being balanced. Each day in the meal plan should be labeled by the day name starting with Sunday. Ensure that each dish utilizes a trusted nutritional source and provides that recipe with a source. Each meal must have a linked recipe from a trustworthy source.

The meals will be prepared for my girlfriend and I, and we generally like Italian, American, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Latin, and Caribbean meals. Each meal should require no more than 45 minutes to prepare with one single exception allowed. 

Let's present the meal plan in 2 different formats as defined below:
1. Detailed Summary: List the entire meal plan, being sure to include each dish, a link to its recipe, an estimate of preparation time, and a list of the required ingredients. Please provide this formatted as a Markdown code block.
2. A shopping list: List every ingredient required for any meal in the meal plan. If an ingredient is required multiple times, specify so with a count of how many different meals the ingredient is required in. If an ingredient is optional, specify that as well. This format should be outputted in a Github-flavored markdown checklist contained within a code block.
